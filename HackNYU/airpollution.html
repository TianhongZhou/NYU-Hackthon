                        The type of pollutants generated from industrial emissions are closely 
                        related to the industrial purpose of each factories. These days, we can 
                        often see enormous clouds of smoke billowed out of the chimney around the 
                        globe, transporting pollutants into the atmosphere.

                    <span>Fuel Combustion</span>
                    <p>
                        The combustion process of fuel (coal, oil and natural gas, etc.) produces 
                        a significant amount of pollutants that are being transported into the 
                        atmosphere. When fuel is burned, lots of dust is produced, as well as 
                        pollution substances (ex. carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen oxides).

                    <span>Automobile Exhaust</span>
                    <p>
                        The exhaust gas from automobiles, ships, and airplanes is the main source 
                        of air pollution. As we use these vehicles, the combustion of internal 
                        engines produce these exhaust gases (ie. carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons).
