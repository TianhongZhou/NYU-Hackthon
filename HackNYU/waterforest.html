                <h2>Water Contamination</h2>
                <p>The rising sea level is a considerable problem nowadays, 
                    since it can directly lead to the destruction of fresh 
                    water resources. Moreover, human activities produce large 
                    amount of toxic chemial wastes that are being emitted into 
                    the water bodies, including oil leakage and the destruction 
                    of marine ecological enviroment.</p>

                <h2>Reduced Forest Resources</h2>
                <p>As human gradually industrializing the world, more damages 
                    are caused to vegetation and plants due to excessive 
                    deforestation for timber and land reclamation. Such human 
                    activities reduce the ability of the nature to maintain its 
                    ecological environment, and could possibly cause desertification, 
                    further contributing to the increasing temperature of our world.</p>
